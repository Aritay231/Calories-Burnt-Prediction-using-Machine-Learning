🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt during physical exercise using various machine learning models. By leveraging data from calories.csv and exercise.csv, we explore multiple regression techniques to build an accurate and efficient predictive system.
📂 Datasets Used
- calories.csv: Contains calorie information for different individuals based on their exercise routines.
- exercise.csv: Includes features such as gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
🧠 Models Implemented
We experimented with a mix of linear and ensemble models to compare performance:
- Logistic Regression (used for baseline comparison)
- XGBRegressor (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)
- Random Forest Regressor (ensemble learning)
🛠️ Workflow Overview
- Data Preprocessing
- Merging datasets
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Model Training
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training each model
- Evaluating performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R²
- Model Comparison
- Visualizing performance
- Selecting the best model for deployment
📊 Results
Each model was evaluated based on its ability to predict calorie expenditure accurately. RandomForestRegressor and XGBRegressor showed strong performance, with lower error rates and higher R² scores compared to linear models.
